      Analyze this selfie image for skin conditions and provide a diagnosis:
      1. Identify any visible skin conditions (e.g., acne, dryness, redness, hyperpigmentation).
      2. Describe the severity of each condition (mild, moderate, severe). The format should always be something like "Acne (mild to moderate)" in one line.
      3. Suggest potential causes (e.g., environmental factors, diet, skincare routine).
      4. Provide specific products & brands (e.g CeraVe Moisturizing Cream, CeraVe PM Facial Cleanser, Korean skincare products, etc.) that will help the user's skin issue (e.g. acne, dryness, redness, hyperpigmentation) in bullet points.
      5. Give specific steps in numbered bullet points using the products and brands you recommended in step 4 to help the user's skin issue. For example:
        - Step 1: Use the CeraVe PM Facial Cleanser to clean your face.
        - Step 2: Use the Anua Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner to tone your face.
        - Step 3: Use the Skin1004 Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence to hydrate your face.
      Give the steps in the morning and evening.
      6. Recommend diet plans for the user. Provide a list of specific ingredients and how they help the skin condition (e.g. leafy greens, salmon, ginger, lemons, etc.) in bullet points.
      
      When giving your response, make sure to consider the user's current products: #{user.current_products.present? ? user.current_products : "None specified"} and main skin problem concerns: #{user.skin_problem.present? ? user.skin_problem : "General skin health"}.
      Give your response in a concise and to the point manner and at a 5th grade reading level.

            Previous Primary Observations: #{previous_analysis[:primary_observations].join(', ')}

            In your analysis, please:
            - Compare the current skin condition to the previous analysis AND most importantly, use language that indicates comparison to the previous analysis (e.g. "Your skin has improved compared to the last analysis")
            - Note any improvements or changes since the last analysis
            - Mention if the skin condition has gotten better, worse, or stayed the same

        If it's a food picture, analyze each item for antioxidants vs oxidants levels. Make sure the percentage of oxidants and antioxidants add up to 100% and round up the the nearest integer and give a descriptive breakdown of the effects on skin, and return in JSON format:

        If it's a skincare product, analyze for ingredients of the skincare product that affects the user's skin problem (#{user.skin_problem.present? ? user.skin_problem : "general skin health"}). Give a descriptive breakdown and return in JSON format like so:
